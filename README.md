# Cloud Tunneling Server

## 🚀 Overview

This repository contains the code for the **cloud tunneling server** that works in conjunction with the localhost tunneling system. This implementation runs on an AWS server and handles incoming requests from the public internet, forwarding them to the locally running services on your machine.

**Note**: This repository is specifically for the server that will run on the cloud.

## 🌐 Features

- **Handle external requests**: Accept incoming requests from users over the internet.
- **Communication with local servers**: Uses Socket.IO to connect with the localhost tunneling system for seamless data transfer.
- **Real-time data handling**: Efficiently processes and forwards requests to ensure real-time communication.
